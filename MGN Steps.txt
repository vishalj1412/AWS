Fist Time setup:
  Step 1 : creating the Replication Settings template.
            - Go to MGN
			- click on get Started. then yo will automaticaly goes in You will automatically be prompted to create the Replication Settings template 
			   the first time you log into Application Migration Service.
			-Configurable Replication Server settings include:
                -The Subnet within which the Replication Server will be launched
				-Replication Server instance type
				-Amazon EBS volume types
                -Amazon EBS encryption
				-Security groups
				-Configure Data routing and throttling
			- then click on create template.
			- you can edite it by clicking settings.
			
Step 2: Add Sourse server.
        - add sourse server by installing replication agent.
		- After adding sourse server it will go in following lifecycle steps:
			Not ready - The server is undergoing the Initial Sync process and is not yet ready for testing. Data replication can only commence once all of the Initial Sync steps have been completed.
			Ready for testing - The server has been successfully added to Application Migration Service and data replication has started. Test or Cutover instances can now be launched for this server.
			Test in progress - A Test instance is currently being launched for this server.
			Ready for cutover - This server has been tested and is now ready for a Cutover instance to be launched.
			Cutover in progress - A Cutover instance is currently being launched for this server.
			Cutover complete - This server has been cutover. All of the data on this server has been migrated to the AWS Cutover instance.
			Disconnected - This server has been disconnected from Application Migration Service.
			
Steps 3 : Configuring launch settings :
           - click on sourse server. 
		   - under that click on lunch settings.
		   - by clicking edit , edit genral lunch settings.
		   - by clicking modify , you can modify EC2 lunch template.
Launch settings are composed of the following:
-Instance type right-sizing - The Instance type right-sizing feature allows Application Migration Service to launch a Test or Cutover instance type that best matches 
      the hardware configuration of the source server. When enabled, this feature overrides the instance type selected in the EC2 Launch Template.
-Start instance upon launch - Choose whether you want to start your test and cutover instances automatically upon launch or whether
               you want to start them manually through the Amazon EC2 Console.
-Copy private IP - Choose whether you want Application Migration Service to verify that the private IP used by the Test or Cutover instance matches the private IP used by the source server.
-Transfer server tags - Choose whether you want Application Migration Service to transfer any user-configured custom tags from your source servers to your Test or Cutover instance.
-OS Licensing - Choose whether you want to Bring Your Own Licenses (BYOL) from the source server to the Test or Cutover instance.
		   
Steps 4: Launching a Test instance :
        - for lounch test server check following things :
			-Under the Migration lifecycle column, the server should show Ready for testing
			-Under the Data replication status column, the server should show the Healthy status.
			-Under the Next step column, the server should show Launch test instance
		
		- then go to sourse server select checkbox of one or mltiple sourse sourse server.
        - open Test and Cutover
		-Under Testing, choose the Launch test instances option to launch a test instance for this server.
        - then click on lounch.
		-The Application Migration Service Console will indicate Launch job started when the test has started.
		-Choose View job details on the dialog to view the specific Job for the test launch in the Launch History tab.
        - check test instance lounche succefully by checking following things.
		         -The Alerts column will show the Launched status, indicating that a Test instance has been launched for this server.
                 -The Migration lifecycle column will show Test in progress.
                 -The Next step column will show Complete testing and mark as 'Ready for cutover'.
                 
Marking as Ready for cutover:
            -Check the box to the left of every source server that has a launched Test instance for which you want to finalize the test.
			-Open the Test and Cutover menu.
			-Under Testing, choose Mark as "Ready for cutover"
			- select check box yes terminate the lunched instance.
			- click on continue.
			-go to that instance and terminate it.
			
			
			
			
Step 5: Lounching Cutover instance :
          - cutover by looking for the following indicators on the Source Servers page :
		        -Under the Migration lifecycle column, the server should show Ready for cutover .
				-Under the Data replication status column, the server should show the Healthy status.
				-Under the Next step column, the server should show Terminate launched instance; Launch cutover instance if you have not terminated your latest launched Test instance.
				-Alternatively, the Next step column will show Launch cutover instance if you have terminated your latest launched Test instance.
		 -then go to the Source servers page and check the box to the left of each server you want to cutover.
		 -Open the Test and Cutover menu.
		 -Under Cutover, choose the Launch cutover instances option.
		 -then click om Lunch.
		 -On the Source Servers page, the Migration lifecycle column will show Cutover in progress and the Next step column will show Finalize cutover.
		 -Successful cutover launch indicators: 
				-The Alerts column will state Launched.
				-The Migration lifecycle column will state Cutover in progress.
				-The Data replication status will state Healthy.
				-The Next step column will state Finalize cutover.


Finalizing a cutover:

              -Check the box to the left of every source server that has a launched Cutover instance you want to finalize.
              -Open the Test and Cutover menu.
			  -Under Cutover, choose Finalize cutover
			  - then click on Finalize.
			  
To archive your cutover source servers:

               -Check the box to the left of the of each source server for which the Migration lifecycle column states Cutover complete.
			   -Open the Actions menu and choose Mark as archived.
			   - click on Archive
